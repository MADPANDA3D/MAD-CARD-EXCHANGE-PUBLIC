### Scan and identify
![Scan and identify](assets/screenshots/scan-identify.jpg)

Scan your cards the way that feels effortless. Line up the card in the on-screen frame and it snaps instantly, or tap to capture whenever you want. No fuss, no guessing.

Need speed? Switch to Multi-Scan and blaze through stacks. Prefer precision? Single Scan keeps it focused. Auto or manual, fast or careful, the scan flow adapts to how you like to collect.
